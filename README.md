# Fusion of high spatial resolution and high frequency model reanalysis for sea-wind


UERRA provide high frequency wind reanalysis but on a coarse spatial resolution; on the other hand, Sentinel 1 derived sea-wind estimation is at high resolution, but only sporadically available. The need for high resolution sea-wind estimation can be critical for an optimal wind turbine positioning. Multiple geostatistical methods exist and can provide estimates of at high spatiotemporal resolutions, but each relying on some strong hypothesis such as stationarity (pattern are spatially independent). In this project we propose to overcome this limitation by using a Machine Learning approach, in particular locally weighted CNN to create an optimal estimation for each point in space.
